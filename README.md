This repository has been created to colate all the code developed as part of the code club of the computational hydrology group overseen by Dr. Elizabeth Lewis at Newcastle University.

The following is a list of the task overtaken as part of the group:

## Task 1. SHETRAN Input Files -  Feb 2022
**participants:** *Irina Rohrmueller (IR) and Luis FP Velasquez (LV)*

As part of this task we aim to develop a series of processes that will enable the creation of the files necessary as inputs for the physically-based model SHETRAN
  1. setting_mask.py -> this uses a catchment geometry (shapefile) to generate the catchment mask for SHETRAN. The process uses pyQgis.
